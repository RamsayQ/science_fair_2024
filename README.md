# Project Overview

This contains the results of a 7th grade science experiment in weather forecasting accuracy.

Research Question: How accurate is weather forecasting?

Hypotheses: (1) The closer the forecast is to the day of the forecast will provide higher accuracy; (2) warmer weather will be easier to forecast than colder weather.

Independent variable: Forecast accuracy measured as the difference between actual maximum and minimum forecasts for 0-13 days ahead for Alexandria, Virginia for the period of January 1, 2021 to March 1, 2024.

Dependent variable: Actual maximum and minimum temperatures in Alexandria, Virginia for the period of January 1, 2021 to March 12, 2024. Combining the forecasts for maximum and minimium temperatures gives the experiment 34,668 observations.

Control variables: To compare Alexandria to a warmer climate, the same analysis is conducted for Orlando, Flordia giving another 34,668 observations.

# Science Fair Project Conclusions 

1. Forecasts of both maximum and minimum temperatures were more accurate for Orlando than Alexandria for the period under study, January 1 2021 to March 1 2024.

2. On average, forecasts for 0-13 days in advance were off by 2.2 degrees for maximum temperatures for Alexandria and -0.1  for degrees for Orlando. Forecasts for minimum temperatures were off by 2.0 degrees for Alexandria and -1.4 degrees for Orlando. This suggests that it may be harder to forecast in cooler than warmer climates. The average maximum temperature for Alexandria was X and Y for Orlando.

3. Forecasts were more accurate the closer you get to the forecast day, for both cities, for maximum temperatures but less so for minimumm temperatures. Forecasts issued 9-13 days in advance were off by over 3 degrees on average. This fell to less than 2 from day 8 and after. Forecasts for minimum temperatures were at about the same accuracy from 0 to 13 days in advance. This suggests that it is more difficult to forecast high temperatures than low temperatures.

4. The experiment provides some evidence that it may be more difficult to predict the weather in the future. Climate change is supposed to make weather patterns more volatile. Going back to 2021, forecasts for Orlando were more accurate than Alexandria. The volatility of Orlando weather is about half that of Alexandria. The standard deviation of high temperatures in Orlando was 8.8 and for Alexandria it was 16.8. The standard deviation for Orlando minimum tempatures 9.8 and for Alexandria it was 15.8.
